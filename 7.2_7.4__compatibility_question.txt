Hello, Doug. I am translating your PHP7 cookbook to Russian. 
Can you tell me, please, how your code in the book works with new versions of PHP from 7.2 to 7.4? 
Is the book absolutely actual now? Unfortunately, I do not find another channel for communication. 
Thanks a lot for your time! My e-mail: novikoiva@gmail.com. Certainly, if you want you can write an answer here. Thanks again!
